Hlm at your fingertips

This repo currently just has `340-脂砚斋重批红楼梦.txt` and `david-hawks-the-story-of-the-stone.txt`. It may expand to other versions. If you wish to have one particular version included, make a `pull request` (fork, upload files and click the pull request button) or provide a text file to me.
